**I am Danwand, Nice Meeting you! 😄**  ✨ ✨

I design intelligent systems and interrogate complex ones.

MSc in Artificial Intelligence.  
Security researcher. Systems builder. Relentless optimizer.

I build production AI, audit infrastructure, and engineer platforms where failure is not theoretical, it’s expected and planned for.

#### What I work on

- Applied AI & large-scale ML systems
- Adversarial AI & model security
- Cybersecurity research & offensive testing
- Backend architecture & cloud infrastructure
- Data engineering & analytics pipelines
- Automation systems that remove human friction

Recent focus includes Custom language based AI guardrails, cyber range platforms, anomaly detection, and defence research.

## Philosophy

Complex systems don’t fail randomly.
They fail predictably if you understand them well enough.

My work is about finding those edges before they find you.
